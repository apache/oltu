    <section name="HowTo Release Apache Amber">
      <p>This short guide is for volunteers that intend to cover the role of Release Manager</p>
    </section>

    <section name="Prerequisites">
      <ul>
        <li>Install/Configure <code>GPG</code> - The artifacts that are deployed to the ASF central repository need to
        be signed. To do this you will need to have a public and private keypair. There is a very good
        <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/">guide</a> that will
        walk you though this.</li>

        <li>Install Apache Maven 2.2.1 or higher. 2.2.0 has a bug that will produce invalid checksums; we strongly
        encourage our committers to install Apache Maven 3.0.4.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section name="Configuration">
      <subsection name="Apache Maven">
        <p>As of Maven 2.1.0 you can now encrypt your servers passwords. We highly recommend that you follow this
        <a href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html">guide</a> to set your master password and
        use it to encrypt your ASF password in the next section.</p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="ASF settings">
        <p>Using the instructions from the previous step encrypt your Sonatype password and add the following servers to
        your <code>~/.m2/settings.xml</code> file. You may already have other servers in this file. If not just create
        the file.</p>

    <section name="Release steps">
      <subsection name="Prepare the source for release">
        <ol>
          <li>Clean up JIRA so the <b>Fix Version</b> in issues resolved since the last release includes this release
          version correctly. Also, transition any <b>Resolved</b> issues to the <b>Closed</b> state.
          </li>
          <li> Update the text files in a working copy of the project root:
            <ol>
              <li>Update the <tt>CHANGES</tt> based on the Text release reports from JIRA.</li>
              <li>Review and update <tt>README</tt> if needed.</li>
              <li>Commit any changes back to svn: <pre>svn commit -m "updating files for release"</pre>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Perform a full build and deploy the SNAPSHOT artifacts: <pre>mvn clean deploy</pre></li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Get source tree">
        <ol>
          <li><strong><em>Only for new major releases (like 1.0.0 to 1.1.0):</em></strong>
          <br/>
          Create a sub-branch from which to make the release.
          <br/>
          Releasing from a branch will allow any cosmetic changes that need to be made for the release to be 
          approved to be done without preventing other more disruptive advances in the trunk from potentially 
          causing problems with the release. It also provides a future maintenance branch (like 1.0.x.)
          <br/>
          A branch can be made by running:
          <pre>mvn release:branch -DbranchName=1.0.x</pre></li>
          <li>Checkout a clean copy of the trunk/branch to release using command line svn:
          <pre>svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/amber/trunk/ release</pre></li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Prepare the release">
        <ol>
          <li>Do a dry run of the <tt>release:prepare</tt> step.
          <pre>mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true</pre>

          The dry run will not commit any changes back to SVN and gives you the opportunity to verify that the 
          release process will complete as expected.

          <p><em>If you cancel a <tt>release:prepare</tt> before it updates the pom.xml versions, then use the 
          <tt>release:clean</tt> goal to just remove the extra files that were created.</em></p></li>

          <li>Verify that the release process completed as expected:
            <ol>
              <li>The release plugin will create <code>pom.xml.tag</code> files which contain the changes that would
              have been committed to SVN. The only differences between <code>pom.xml.tag</code> and its corresponding 
              <code>pom.xml</code> file should be the version
              number.</li>

              <li>If other formatting changes have been made you should review the changes and then commit them:
              <pre>svn commit -m "fixing formatting for release"</pre></li>

              <li>Assuming the <code>.tag</code> files look OK you may proceed and do any other validation you feel
              necessary. The following list may be helpful:
                <ol>
                  <li>Check <tt>release.properties</tt> and make sure that the scm properties have the right version.
                  Sometimes the scm location can be the previous version not the next version.</li>

                  <li>Verify signatures: On Un*x platforms the following command can be executed:
<source>for file in `find . -type f -iname '*.asc'`
do
  gpg --verify ${file}
done</source>

                  You'll need to look at the output to ensure it contains only good signatures:
<source>gpg: Good signature from ...
gpg: Signature made ...</source>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>Once any failures or required updates have been committed to svn, rollback the release prepare files:
              <source>mvn release:rollback</source></li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Run the <tt>release:prepare</tt> step for real this time. You'll be prompted for the same version
          information and optionally your GPG passphrase again. <pre>mvn release:prepare</pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Perform the release">
        <ol>
          <li>
            From the directory where you have launched <tt>release:prepare</tt> execute (this step will create a maven staging repository):
            <source>mvn release:perform [-Duser.name=&lt;your_apache_uid&gt;]</source>

            <p>
              <em>If your local OS userid doesn't match your Apache userid, then you'll have to also override the value 
                provided by the OS to Maven for the site-deploy step to work. This is known to work for Linux, 
                but not for Mac and unknown for Windows.
              </em>
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Verify the staged artifacts in the Nexus repository:

Subject: [VOTE] Release Apache Amber X.Y

Hi,

We solved N issues:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311100&styleName=Html&version=X.Y

There are still a couple of issues left in JIRA:
http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&pid=12311100&status=1

SVN source tag (r9999999):
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/amber/tags/X.Y/

Staging repo:
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapacheamber-[YOUR REPOSITORY ID]/

Staging site:
http://incubator.apache.org/amber/X.Y/

PGP release keys (signed using ABCDEFG):
http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/amber/KEYS

Vote will be open for 72 hours.

[ ] +1, let's get it ruuuumbleeeeee!!!
[ ] +/-0, fine, but consider to fix few issues before...
[ ] -1, nope, because... (and please explain why)]]></pre>
          </li>

          <li>Create a <code>DISCUSS</code> email thread on <code>amber-dev@</code> for any vote questions, e.g.:
            <pre><![CDATA[To: "Apache Amber Developers List" <amber-dev@incubator.apache.org>
Subject: [DISCUSS] Apache Amber X.Y

Discussion thread for vote on &lt;version&gt; release candidate, with SVN source tag (r9999999).

For more information on the release process, check out http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html

Some of the things to check before voting are:
 - does "mvn rat:check" pass on the source
 - can you build the contents of source-release.zip and svn tag
 - do all of the staged jars/zips contain the required LICENSE and NOTICE files
 - are all of the staged jars signed and the signature verifiable
 - is the signing key in the project's KEYS file and on a public server (i.e. http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/amber/)]]>
            </pre>
          </li>

          <li>Perform a review of the release and cast your vote. For more details on Apache releases see
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html">http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html</a>.</li>

          <li>A <code>-1</code> vote does not necessarily mean that the vote must be redone, however it is usually a
          good idea to rollback the release if a <code>-1</code> vote is received
          (see "Recovering from a vetoed release" below).</li>

          <li>After the vote has been open for at least 72 hours, has at least three +1 PMC votes and no -1 votes, then
          post the results to the vote thread, replying to the initial email prepending <code>[RESULT]</code> to the
          original subject and include a list of every binding <code>+1</code>, <code>0</code> and <code>-1</code> vote.
